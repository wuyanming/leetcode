-- 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

-- Approach I: Using WHERE clause [Accepted]

SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary;



		
-- Approach I: Using JOIN clause [Accepted]
-- Actually, JOIN is a more common and efficient way to link tables together, and we can use ON to specify some conditions.

SELECT
     a.NAME AS Employee
FROM Employee AS a JOIN Employee AS b
     ON a.ManagerId = b.Id
     AND a.Salary > b.Salary;
