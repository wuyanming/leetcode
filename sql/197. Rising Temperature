FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.date, w.date) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature;




select b.id from Weather a, Weather b
where b.Recorddate = dateadd(day,1,a.recorddate)
and a.temperature < b.temperature;




SELECT DISTINCT w2.ID AS Id

FROm Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON w1.id = w2.id - 1

WHERE w2.Temperature > w1.Temperature
