SELECT

    Employee alias

    Employee.Company = alias.Company

/* The SIGN() function returns the sign of a number.

This function will return one of the following:

If number is greater than zero, it returns 1
If number is equal to zero, it returns 0
If number is less than zero, it returns -1 */
