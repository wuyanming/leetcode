The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

| 0.0000 |

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.



Create table If Not Exists Numbers (Number int, Frequency int)
Truncate table Numbers
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('0', '7')
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('1', '1')
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('2', '3')
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('3', '1')



select  avg(n.Number) median
from Numbers n
where n.Frequency >= abs((select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.Number) -
                         (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number>=n.Number))
